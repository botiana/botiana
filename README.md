# botiana

## Getting started
I highly suggest running this in a virtual environment. But, make your own choice, this isn't Soviet Russia.

### Install requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Settings
Copy the settings file and customize it.
```sh
cp example_settings.py
settings.py
```

## Execution
`./botiana.py`
